# ü§ñ AI Tools Assignment ‚Äì Group Project

## üìå Overview

This project demonstrates our understanding and application of core AI tools and frameworks, combining theoretical knowledge, practical skills, and ethical awareness. We used **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow**, **spaCy**, and **Jupyter/Colab** environments to explore machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing techniques.

## üìö Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

- **Q&A on AI tools** like TensorFlow vs. PyTorch, spaCy vs. basic NLP, Jupyter Notebooks for prototyping, and more.
- **Comparative analysis**: We compared Scikit-learn and TensorFlow based on use case focus, ease of use, and community support.
- Answers are in: `Part1_Theory/theory_answers.md` or `.ipynb`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Part 2: Practical Implementation

### üîπ Task 1: Classical ML (Scikit-learn ‚Äì Iris Dataset)
- Preprocessed and trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** on the Iris dataset.
- Achieved 100% accuracy on test samples.
- File: `Part2_Practical/Task1_ScikitLearn_Iris/iris_classifier.ipynb`

### üîπ Task 2: Deep Learning (TensorFlow ‚Äì MNIST)
- Built a **CNN** using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits.
- Achieved **>98% accuracy** on test data.
- Visualized predictions on sample images.
- File: `Part2_Practical/Task2_TensorFlow_MNIST/mnist_cnn_classifier.ipynb`

### üîπ Task 3: NLP (spaCy ‚Äì Amazon Product Reviews)
- Extracted **Named Entities** (e.g., product names/brands).
- Performed **rule-based sentiment analysis** (positive/negative).
- File: `Part2_Practical/Task3_spaCy_NLP/amazon_reviews_nlp.ipynb`

## ‚öñÔ∏è Part 3: Ethics and Debugging

### ‚úÖ Ethical Reflection
- We analyzed **bias in MNIST** (e.g., cultural handwriting variation) and **bias in sentiment rules**.
- Discussed how tools like **TensorFlow Fairness Indicators** and smarter NLP models can help.
- File: `Part3_Ethics_And_Optimization/ethics_and_bias_reflection.md`

### ‚úÖ Debugging Challenge
- Fixed a buggy TensorFlow MNIST model (dimension mismatch).
- File: `Part3_Ethics_And_Optimization/debug_fix_mnist_tensorflow.ipynb`
